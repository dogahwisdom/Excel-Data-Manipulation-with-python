# Excel Data Manipulation with Python

## Project Overview
This project, developed by Wisdom Dogah, demonstrates how to manipulate and visualize Excel data using Python. It leverages the power of openpyxl for Excel operations, pandas for data manipulation, and win32com to interact with Excel applications programmatically. This project automates the process of creating an Excel workbook from a pandas DataFrame and then opens the resulting file using Excel.

## Features
- **Dataframe to Excel Conversion**: Converts a pandas DataFrame into an Excel workbook.
- **Excel Automation**: Automatically opens the created Excel file for viewing.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: The main programming language used.
- **openpyxl**: A Python library for reading and writing Excel (with .xlsx extension) files.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for Python, used for handling and analyzing data.
- **win32com**: A Python library for Windows-specific operations, used here to interact with Microsoft Excel.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install openpyxl pandas pywin32
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Create an Excel workbook named `pandas.xlsx` with the data from the DataFrame.
- Automatically open the workbook in Excel for viewing.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main script that contains the logic for data manipulation and Excel automation.
